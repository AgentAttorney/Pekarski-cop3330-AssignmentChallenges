# Pekarski-cop3330-AssignmentChallenges
Hopefully, I won't need these for EC.

Overall did 13 Challenges, and for each exercise's challenges, combined them together. All exercises are in one GUI which you navigate by clicking "NEXT ASSIGNMENT ->"
Breakdown of which Challenges I did (All from Assignment 1); I did these challenges all in GUI since I wanted practice for GUI as well as lambda expressions

Exercise 1: 
Challenges (2): Display greeting in GUI, display greeting for different people (The two names I made were Hollander and Mik), otherwise it randomizes among a pool of greetings

Exercise 2:
Challenges (2): State user must enter something into the program, and updates character count in real time

Exercise 5:
Challenges (4): Breaks the computation into functions, GUI updates in real time, Effectively ignores non-numeric and negative inputs

Exercise 7:
Challenges (3): Allow user to select Meters or Feet. GUI program updates values in real time and does not calculate non-numeric values

Exercise 9:
Challenges (2): Revise the program to disallow non-numeric input and allows support for circular rooms (Squares, Rectangles, and Circles). Also is in GUI cause I wanted practice.
